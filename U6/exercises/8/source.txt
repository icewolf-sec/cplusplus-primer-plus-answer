Good morning. I'm Chen huan. Here's my culture report for today, Monday:
A new film starts tonight at the student cinema at eight o'clock. The film is Pirates of the Caribbean. It's a fantastic adventure film. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are the stars. They are both very popular and famous, and they both act well in this film, and make their characters believable.
The story is about an old ship. It sails around the Caribbean islands. Depp and Bloom try to find some lost gold. Then they come face to face with some terrible men, and have to fight them. There's lost of action, and the fighting looks really dangerous. They also save Keira Knightley. She plays Elisabeth, the daughter of a rich man. The scenes with Knightley and Bloom are beautiful and romantic.
The film isn't true to life, but it's very exciting, and some of it is very funny. it's an enjoyable film, although in my opinion there's too much fighting. But except for that, it's an excellent film. If you didn't see it when it first came out, I advise you to go and see it now. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It's showing all week.
